# Brighterly

**Brighterly** - is an online math school for children. We are building an educational ecosystem to become the “home page” for learning math for children and their parents. Brighterly is developing the next EdTech unicorn in a $130 billion market.
## Technologies Used

For the development of my project, I employed a combination of advanced web technologies to ensure a high-quality, responsive, and user-friendly application.

**Frontend Technologies:**

- **Semantic HTML:** Used for better accessibility and SEO.
- **CSS and SCSS:** Applied for styling, with advanced features including mixins, extends, and variables to streamline and manage styles efficiently.
- **Responsive Design:** Implemented a responsive layout with adaptive adjustments for various devices, including mobile-first design and tablet adaptation.
- **Rem Conversion:** Ensured consistent scaling across different screen sizes by converting units to rem.

**JavaScript and Vue:**

- **Vue:** Utilized for building dynamic user interfaces.

**Libraries and Tools:**

- **Swiper.js:** Integrated for implementing interactive and responsive sliders.
- **Biome:** Used for code formatting and maintaining consistency.

These technologies and practices collectively contribute to creating a well-structured, visually appealing, and adaptable application.
